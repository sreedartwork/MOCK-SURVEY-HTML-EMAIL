MOCK-SURVEY-HTML-EMAIL
I used the MJML App to do this email. I wanted to use an alternative to the Foundation for email frame-work.
I also used A Dev Starter Kit from Coding Phase Github.
This helped speed up the process of the gulp task manager for compiling to production and browser-sync for auto reload for dev.
